# Jean-Hugues Kabuiku  Resume 
Technology is for me a tool allowing me to express my creativity. [Producer of electronic music](https://soundcloud.com/amazinggaijin) and tech enthusiast Techcrunch, reading Gizmodo and Hackernews are part of my morning routine.

My passions allowed me to etablish a network through Europe in the sectors of musics and the technologies, sectors between which the borders are getting thinner.

Ex dev bootcamp [simplon.co](http://simplon.co/) alumni and Growth Hacker intern at the french investment firm  [TheFamily ](http://www.thefamily.co/), i can say that i have solid foundation in web development and webmarketing.
